After about a year of self-teaching and two consecutive unsuccessful final round interviews, I've found myself stuck in 
a bit of a rut, in terms of both productivity and positivity. I've often found that, when working independently, it 
helps to set arbitrary goals, and so I've decided (rather late in the day) that this month I'm going to write a blog 
post every day!

Of course the quality won't be as high as I'd like and it's gonna be difficult, but I figure it'll be a positive 
experience regardless, and I think the quality barrier has prevented me from getting some of my work out on the 
internet. I'll likely cycle between talking about previous projects, current/future work, and shorter paper reviews or 
general thoughts, which should be less time-consuming. I'd also like to do one paper replication per week and one 
larger project over the course of the month that showcases engineering skill.

Stay tuned!
