Kid
- As a kid, I spent most of my time doing maths problems, playing in chess tournaments, and practising music
- I did well enough at these, but as with all things there was a feeling that I could never quite get over the hump of 
"true excellence". In maths, I was invited to an IMO training camp but never made the team; in chess, I played on the 
national squad but I was a dirty e4 player and the worst on my school team; in music, I became technically proficient 
but never had the inherent passion and drive to put in sufficient hours of practice.
- I lost my mum to cancer during this time. This planted a desire in me to work on healthcare-related problems, but I 
felt that my skillset wasn't well suited. Specifically, my memory recall sucked and I knew this was a core skill in 
studying medicine. Also, it was a tough time so I found comfort in what I was good at. I stuck to maths. My brother was 
braver and went for medicine. Despite the difficulties he's faced, I'm proud of him.
- I considered applying to study Engineering at uni but I felt that this was a high variance option as I had no idea 
what to expect from interviews. Cambridge maths admissions, on the other hand, were known for being straightforward but 
tough. I went for it and got into Trinity to study maths!
- I vividly remember stumbling across Andrew Ng's Coursera course on ML in like 2012 while on a family holiday in 
Hong Kong and telling everyone that would listen that it was super cool that I could train a net to recognise written
numbers. Unfortunately no-one was particularly impressed and I didn't take it any further.

Uni
- Maths was tough. During first year I was really excited to play sports (growing up, my weekends were always taken up
by Chinese school and church so I never had time). I got into rowing and basketball and caught up on sleep during 
lectures. Unsurprisingly, I did poorly and got a 2:2.
- In my second year, I realised that I didn't see a future in maths. I never wanted to be an academic mathematician and 
for working in the real world, I figured that there was only so much maths you needed to know. I put in the work to 
catch up on my abysmal first year, secured a 2:1, and asked to transfer to Engineering, where I hoped to pursue more 
practical studies.
- When I got to the Engineering department, I was overwhelmed by choice. I could study quantum computing, nuclear 
energy, bridge building, medical imaging, cars, planes, and more! I really enjoyed the lab setting and opportunities 
for collaborating. I picked a wide range of modules but gravitated towards electrical engineering, AI, and medical 
applications. My favourite course during this time was Computational Neuroscience, which lay nicely at the intersection 
between maths, medicine, and computing. Working on fun stuff paid off and I finally got a first.
- Fourth year was disrupted by COVID. I was building towards an AI career with a dissertation on causal inference and 
counterfactual data in clinical trials, but my supervisor was very busy managing her group even before COVID hit and 
after that we had very few contact hours. The internships and fellowships I applied for were all cancelled and I felt 
pretty demoralised.

Career
- I wanted a break from AI but was still interested in pursuing research work. I'd been a massive fan of Google Glass 
when it was kind of a thing and saw an opening at Microsoft Research Cambridge to work as a research engineer 
supporting a team of optical engineers designing experimental prototypes. Specifically, we were trying to make 
multi-lens arrays consisting of 3d-tessellated hexagonal lenses, each with their own unique curved surfaces. In order 
to do this, our team developed a CSG-based ray tracing library in Julia called OpticSim.jl, and I worked to maintain
and apply this to prototype designs. Unfortunately Microsoft decided to pull funding for the role and I had to move on.
- Following this, I'd always been curious about the food industry and I didn't really have any idea where my career was 
going, so I hit up a friend from school who had helped to start up a food stall in Spitalfieds Market selling biang 
biang noodles. I ended up working there for 6 months, discovering that working in kitchens is tough and something I'm 
happy to leave to the experts. After a shocking near-death experience, I decided to look for more traditional jobs.
- At this point, many of my maths friends from uni were working in quant finance, and one of them reached out to refer 
me to Optiver, a high-frequency trading firm. I went through the interviews and received an offer to join the next grad 
cycle in 6 months' time. I realised I had no real understanding of the financial world so in the meantime I interned 
with another uni friend at a systematic hedge fund, where I helped to build signals for an FX strategy.
- My time at Optiver was tumultuous to say the least. I did pretty well initially, which I mostly attribute to the 
ability not to freak out under pressure. The trainee programme was incredible, and within around 6 months I found 
on the main European index options desk trading my own product! However, I found it tough to manage the load of intense 
screen trading during market hours followed by the desire to work on research tasks after hours, and slowly began to 
burn out.
- As I continued to work, I also discovered aspects of the job and company that I wasn't too pleased with (more on this 
in another post, probably). Ultimately, this led to me leaving the company after about 1.5 years without a real plan as 
to what I would do next.

Break
- 2023 had been a tough year for me, being away from my close friends and family due to living alone in Amsterdam, 
going through a difficult breakup, and not really enjoying my job. I decided to take a break from work for 6 months to 
reset myself and I really enjoyed this time.
- I learnt to box, ski, and scuba dive, went camping in Switzerland and hiking in the Dolomites. When I got back to the 
UK, I got back into basketball and climbing, and co-hosted some incredible dinner parties with my flatmate who'd 
recently graduated from Le Cordon Bleu, going on late-night runs to Billingsgate and Smithfield's (iykyk).
- During this time I caught onto the AI hype, and decided to start self-teaching out of curiosity. I began with the 
ARENA course, developed by members of the AI safety community, and this naturally led to an interest in mech interp,
which led to a personal project focused on interpreting OthelloGPT.
- I got in touch with a two-person startup working on agentic codegen and struggled through a project fine-tuning 
a diff model for them. Also, I reached out to a neuroscience professor at Oxford and began a collaboration on training 
models on survival time data in long-term clinical trials.
- Following this, I continued to build my experience by replicating papers. Most recently, I managed to replicate 
AlphaEvolve and used my implementation to achieve SOTA on a circle packing problem!

Interviews
- I finally felt ready to put myself out there and began applying to companies. But soon discovered that I was very 
much not alone in this space and that the job market had become insanely crowded. I reached out to an experience 
contact who gave me a much needed reality check: I'd have to work my way up, building my public profile, portfolio, and 
network deliberately over time.
- I was fortunate enough to have a small network already, and two referrals led to two great interview experiences. The 
first was at a well-known codegen startup in SF, where I was flown out for a two-day final round onsite which I flunked 
spectacularly, after being asked to book flights on a Saturday to arrive on Sunday and interview Monday-Tuesday. The 
second was at an established drug discovery company in London, where I was ultimately turned down at the final round 
due to insufficient experience for mid-level roles.
- And so here I am, simultaneously encouraged and discouraged by my half-successes, and still looking for a job. At 
times I've felt very foolish and useless for pursuing this career change, but I'm so drawn to the problems that I can't 
see myself looking anywhere else for now. And so I stubbornly keep moving forwards.
- I'm currently working on patching up some knowledge and experience gaps that came up during my interviews. 
Specifically, I'd like to write some explainers on parts that I was weak on and work on some small projects that build 
my experience in areas where I was lacking. I also feel that ML roles are becoming more specialised as the field 
matures, and that it would help to focus on a specific type of role within the pipeline, which I hadn't really thought 
about before. To be continued...
